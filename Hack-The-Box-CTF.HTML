            So, I was at this chellage where it asked about source.
So, I know they meant by inspect element.

This chellange is pretty easy for those who aren't familiar with coding. Website are made out of <b class="key">HTML</b> for <key>structuring.</key>
So, I went to the source for a better view on the code. 
But, I didn't expect it's alrady showing me the <key>vulnerbility.</key>
<b class="CODE">8291</b>!
From there I immediately key in the code since it's straigh forward with the word 'correctpin' as in the key to autenthical access!
Bad code! Very bad code!
That how we found the f1ag is <b>HTB{V13w_50urc3_c4n_b3_u53ful!!!}</b>
